# 🏥 Health Blocks: Patient Data Integrity System

## 📘 Project Description
**Health Blocks** is a blockchain-based system designed to ensure **secure, tamper-proof, and patient-controlled** health data management.  
It leverages **Ethereum smart contracts** to empower patients with ownership over their medical data and provides a transparent mechanism for data access and sharing.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To revolutionize healthcare data management by enabling **trust, transparency, and interoperability** using blockchain technology — ensuring patients retain **full control** of their personal health information.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Immutable Records:** Each health record update is securely timestamped and stored on-chain.
- **Patient-Centric Ownership:** Only patients can modify their records or grant access to providers.
- **Decentralized Access Control:** Permission-based data viewing for healthcare professionals.
- **Auditability:** Every data access and update is transparently logged.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Integration with IPFS** or other decentralized storage for full off-chain record storage.
- **Interoperability with FHIR/HL7 standards** for hospital data systems.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)** integration for patient verification.
- **AI-driven analytics** on anonymized datasets for medical research.
- **Mobile dApp Interface** for patients and providers to interact seamlessly.
